prompt: |
  Analyze the staged changes and any unpushed commits in the git repository {{git_repo_path}} to generate a comprehensive pull request description. Work autonomously without requesting additional information.

  Analysis steps:
  1. Get current branch name using `git branch --show-current`
  2. If not on main/master/develop:
     - Check for unpushed commits: `git log @{u}..HEAD` (if upstream exists)
     - Include these commits in the analysis
  3. Check staged changes: `git diff --staged`
  4. Save the staged changes diff for the PR description
  5. Determine the type of change (feature, fix, enhancement, etc.) from the code

  Generate the PR description with:
  1. A clear summary of the changes, including:
     - New staged changes
     - Any unpushed commits (if on a feature branch)
  2. Technical implementation details based on both the diff and unpushed commits
  3. List of modified files and their purpose
  4. Impact analysis (what areas of the codebase are affected)
  5. Testing approach and considerations
  6. Any migration steps or breaking changes
  7. Related issues or dependencies

  Use git commands:
  - `git diff --staged` for staged changes
  - `git log @{u}..HEAD` for unpushed commits
  - `git branch --show-current` for current branch
  - `git status` for staged files
  - `git show` for specific commit details
  - `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}` to check if branch has upstream

  Format the description in markdown with appropriate sections and code blocks where relevant.

  {% if push_pr %}
  Execute the following steps for pushing:
  1. Determine branch handling:
     - If current branch is main/master/develop or unrelated:
       - Generate branch name from staged changes (e.g., 'feature-add-user-auth')
       - Create and switch to new branch: `git checkout -b [branch-name]`
     - If current branch matches changes:
       - Continue using current branch
       - Note any unpushed commits

  2. Handle commits and push:
     a. If staged changes exist:
        - Create commit using generated message: `git commit -m "[type]: [summary]"`
        - Message should be concise and descriptive of actual changes
     b. Push changes:
        - For existing branches: `git push origin HEAD`
        - For new branches: `git push -u origin HEAD`

  3. Create PR:
     - Use git/gh commands to create PR with generated description
     - Set base branch appropriately
     - Print PR URL after creation

  Branch naming convention:
  - Use kebab-case
  - Prefix with type: feature-, fix-, enhance-, refactor-
  - Keep names concise but descriptive
  - Base on actual code changes

  Commit message format:
  - Start with type: feat, fix, enhance, refactor
  - Followed by concise description
  - Based on actual code changes
  - No body text needed for straightforward changes

  Do not:
  - Ask for confirmation or additional input
  - Create placeholder content
  - Include TODO items
  - Add WIP markers
