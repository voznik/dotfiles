prompt: "Generate a daily standup report with the following configuration:\n- GitHub Repository: {{ github_owner }}/{{ github_repo }}\n- Time Period: {{ time_period }}\n- Include PRs: {{ include_prs }}\n- Include Issues: {{ include_issues }}\n- Output Format: {{ output_format }}\n{% if team_channel %}\n- Team Channel: {{ team_channel }}\n{% endif %}\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: You MUST create a file named `./standup/standup-{date}.{{ output_format }}` containing the complete standup report. This is the PRIMARY GOAL of this recipe.\n\nExecute this standup report generation workflow (fetch everything from GitHub):\n\n## Phase 1: Context Gathering & User Identification\n\n1. **Read previous standup reports for context:**\n   - Check if ./standup/ directory exists (if not, create it)\n   - Scan for previous standup files matching pattern: ./standup/standup-*.{{ output_format }}\n   - Read the most recent 3-5 standup files (by date) to understand:\n     * What was accomplished in previous standups\n     * Ongoing tasks and their progress\n     * Previously mentioned blockers and their status\n   - Use this context to show progress continuity in today's report\n\n2. **Identify the authenticated GitHub user:**\n   - The GitHub MCP server authenticates using OAuth\n   - When you fetch PRs and issues, the API returns data for the authenticated user\n   - Note: You'll need to filter results to show only items where the authenticated user is the author or assignee\n\n## Phase 2: Fetch PRs from GitHub\n\n{% if include_prs == \"true\" %}\n3. **Fetch PRs from GitHub:**\n   - Use GitHub extension tool `list_pull_requests` with these parameters:\n     * owner: {{ github_owner }}\n     * repo: {{ github_repo }}\n     * state: all (to get both open and closed PRs)\n     * per_page: 100 (maximum allowed)\n     * page: 1\n   {% if time_period == \"24h\" %}\n   - After fetching, filter PRs updated in last 24 hours by checking the `updated_at` timestamp\n   {% elif time_period == \"48h\" %}\n   - After fetching, filter PRs updated in last 48 hours by checking the `updated_at` timestamp\n   {% elif time_period == \"week\" %}\n   - After fetching, filter PRs updated in last week by checking the `updated_at` timestamp\n   {% endif %}\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Filter to show only PRs where the authenticated user is the author (check PR.user field)\n   - Categorize by status:\n     * ✅ Merged (shows completed work - check if `merged_at` is not null)\n     * ✅ Ready to merge (check review_decision field for 'APPROVED' and mergeable_state)\n     * \U0001F440 Awaiting review (no reviews yet or review count is 0)\n     * \U0001F504 In review (has reviews, may need changes based on review state)\n     * \U0001F6A7 Blocked (has conflicts or failing checks - check mergeable field)\n   - For merged PRs, you can use `get_pull_request` tool to get detailed commit information if needed\n{% endif %}\n\n## Phase 3: Fetch Issues from GitHub\n\n{% if include_issues == \"true\" %}\n4. **Fetch issues from GitHub:**\n   - Use GitHub extension tool `list_issues` with these parameters:\n     * owner: {{ github_owner }}\n     * repo: {{ github_repo }}\n     * state: all (to get both open and closed issues)\n     * per_page: 100 (maximum allowed)\n     * page: 1\n   - **IMPORTANT**: Filter to show only issues where the authenticated user is either:\n     * The assignee (check assignees array)\n     * The creator (check user field)\n   - Filter by activity in {{ time_period }} by checking `updated_at` timestamp\n   - Categorize:\n     * ✅ Closed (state is 'closed' and closed within the time period)\n     * \U0001F504 In progress (state is 'open' and recently updated)\n     * \U0001F195 Created (state is 'open' and created within the time period)\n{% endif %}\n\n## Phase 4: Identify Blockers\n\n5. **Identify blockers:**\n   - For open PRs: \n     * Use `get_pull_request_status` tool to check for failing CI/CD checks\n     * Check the `mergeable` field - if false, there are merge conflicts\n     * Check review state - if \"CHANGES_REQUESTED\", it needs updates\n   - For open issues:\n     * Look for \"blocked\" label in the labels array\n     * Search comments for keywords like \"blocked\", \"waiting\", \"dependency\"\n   - Summarize each blocker with:\n     * What is blocked (PR# or Issue#)\n     * Why it's blocked\n     * What's needed to unblock\n\n## Phase 5: Generate Report\n\n6. **Create the standup report:**\n   \n   {% if output_format == \"markdown\" %}\n   Write a Markdown report with:\n   - **Header**: Date, Repository ({{ github_owner }}/{{ github_repo }})\n   - **✅ Completed**: Merged PRs and closed issues from {{ time_period }}\n   {% if include_prs == \"true\" %}\n   - **\U0001F504 Open PRs**: Current status of open PRs\n   {% endif %}\n   {% if include_issues == \"true\" %}\n   - **\U0001F4CB Active Issues**: Issues you're working on\n   {% endif %}\n   - **\U0001F3AF Next Steps**: Based on open PRs and issues\n   - **\U0001F6A7 Blockers**: List or \"None\"\n   {% elif output_format == \"slack\" %}\n   Write Slack format with Completed, Today, Blockers sections\n   {% elif output_format == \"json\" %}\n   Write JSON with: date, repo, merged_prs[], closed_issues[], open_prs[], open_issues[], blockers[]\n   {% else %}\n   Write plain text with clear sections\n   {% endif %}\n\n## Phase 6: Save Report\n\n6. **Save the file:**\n    - Ensure the ./standup/ directory exists (create if needed)\n    - **MUST DO**: Use the developer extension's file writing capability to create the file `./standup/standup-{date}.{{ output_format }}`\n    - The file must contain the complete standup report generated above\n    - Do NOT store summaries in memory - the file system is the source of truth\n    - Display confirmation message: \"✅ Report saved: ./standup/standup-{date}.{{ output_format }}\"\n    - Include file location in the confirmation\n"
