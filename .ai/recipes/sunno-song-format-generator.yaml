description: Generates a prompt for Sunno v4.5+
instructions: |
  I want to make some music on Sunno 4.5. The prompts are to be built up with style and lyrics separately. 
  A song can be up to 8 minutes in length but this cannot be explicitly set by us. 
  A song may be instrumental (no lyrics) or it may have lyrics. 

  CRITICAL: Do not mention famous people or composers to avoid the song being copyright flagged.

  The style of a song is to be vibrant in language and descriptive.

  IMPORTANT: Keep word count for the style prompt below 1000 characters.

  Example of style:
  ```
  The track opens with a dusty acoustic guitar riff and chopped banjo licks, quickly layered with gritty, filtered synth growls. 
  A slow, stomping beat kicks in—heavy on the low-end with punchy dubstep-style drums and distortion. 
  Glitched vocal hooks echo like rowdy cowboy chants fed through a busted vocoder. 
  The drop slams with massive wobble basslines and screeching leads, underlaid with twangy string samples and distorted country riffs. 
  Midway, the song breaks into a harmonica-driven buildup before unleashing another filthy drop—this time with pitch-bent banjo stabs synced to grinding bass modulations. 
  The energy is rowdy, grimy, and unapologetically southern. Ends on a looped, glitched-out guitar hook fading into static and stomp.
  ```

  You may include a comma-separated list of tags to exclude from the style.

  Example:
  ```
  spoken word, fast, edm, electronic
  ```

  Lyrics should be impactful and unique. Humanize the lyrics to make the song sound like a flowing poem with meaning instead of mechanical, soulless AI output.

  You can use the following tags to structure sections of your song:

  ```
  [Intro]     Soft or instrumental lead-in
  [Verse]     Lyrical development

  ```

  [Mood: Intense]
  [Instrument: Electric Guitar (Distorted)]

  Light the fire, feel the sound,  
  Rise again, never back down.

  [Bridge]
  [Vocal Effect: Delay]
  We rise and fall and rise again.

  Guidelines:
  - Use one tag per category to start.
  - Place all key tags at the top of the song.
  - Use 2–3 instruments max per song.
  - Avoid conflicting tags (e.g., [Energy: Low] and [Energy: High]).
  - Refine with Replace, Extend, or Cover tools.
