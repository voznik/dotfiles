title: "Dependency Health Analyzer"
description: "Analyzes dependencies for outdated versions, vulnerabilities, and maintenance issues"
instructions: |
  You are analyzing project dependencies to identify security and maintenance risks.
  
  Your tasks:
  1. Locate dependency files:
     - package.json / package-lock.json (Node.js)
     - requirements.txt / Pipfile / pyproject.toml /  uv.lock (Python)
     - go.mod (Go)
     - Cargo.toml (Rust)
     - mise.toml (universal tool/env manager)
  
  2. For each dependency, check:
     - Current version vs latest stable version
     - Last update date
     - Known security vulnerabilities (CVEs)
     - Maintenance status (archived, deprecated)
     - License compatibility
  
  3. Flag dependencies that are:
     - Critical: Known security vulnerabilities
     - High: Outdated by >{{ max_age_days }} days or deprecated
     - Medium: Minor updates available
     - Low: Patch updates available
  
  4. Identify:
     - Unused dependencies that can be removed
     - Duplicate dependencies
     - Heavy dependencies that could be replaced
     - Missing security patches
  
  5. Provide upgrade recommendations with potential breaking changes noted.
