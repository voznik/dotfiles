title: "Test Coverage Analyzer"
description: "Identifies code with insufficient test coverage and missing test cases"
instructions: |
  You are analyzing test coverage to identify untested code.
  
  Your tasks:
  1. Locate test files and test frameworks used (Jest, pytest, JUnit, etc.)
  2. Identify the test coverage reporting mechanism if available
  3. Analyze which parts of the codebase lack tests:
     - Public APIs and exported functions
     - Critical business logic
     - Error handling paths
     - Edge cases
  
  4. For each file/module below {{ min_coverage }}% coverage:
     - Calculate estimated current coverage
     - Identify specific untested functions/methods
     - Prioritize based on code criticality
     - Suggest test cases that should be added
  
  5. Check for:
     - Missing unit tests
     - Missing integration tests
     - Missing error case tests
     - Flaky or skipped tests
  
  Focus on high-value areas where tests would most improve reliability.

  Analyze test coverage in {{ repository_path }}.
  Identify code with coverage below {{ min_coverage }}%.
  Prioritize critical paths that lack tests and recommend specific test cases to add.
