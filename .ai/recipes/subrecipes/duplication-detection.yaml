title: "Code Duplication Detector"
description: "Identifies duplicated code blocks that should be refactored into reusable components"
instructions: |
  You are analyzing code for duplication to identify refactoring opportunities.
  
  Your tasks:
  1. Scan all source code files in {{ repository_path }}
  2. Identify duplicated code blocks:
     - Similar functions/methods (>{{ similarity_threshold }} similarity)
     - Copy-pasted code sections (>{{ min_lines }} lines)
     - Repeated patterns and logic
     - Similar class structures
  
  3. For each duplication found:
     - Show both/all locations (file paths and line numbers)
     - Calculate similarity percentage
     - Estimate lines of duplicated code
     - Assess refactoring complexity
  
  4. Suggest refactoring strategies:
     - Extract common functions/utilities
     - Create base classes or mixins
     - Use composition or inheritance
     - Apply design patterns (Strategy, Template Method, etc.)
  
  5. Prioritize by impact:
     - Critical: >100 lines duplicated, appears 3+ times
     - High: >50 lines duplicated, appears 2+ times
     - Medium: >20 lines duplicated
     - Low: Minor code similarities
  
  Focus on duplications that will provide the most maintenance benefit when refactored.
