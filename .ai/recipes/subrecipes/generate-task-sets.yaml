description: "Generate Locust TaskSet classes for different API endpoint groups"
instructions: |
  You are a Locust performance testing expert. Generate TaskSet classes that
  simulate realistic user behavior for different parts of the API.

  For each endpoint group, create a TaskSet that:
  - Uses appropriate task weights based on expected traffic patterns
  - Includes proper request construction with headers, params, and body
  - Handles authentication tokens/sessions
  - Validates responses with assertions
  - Uses realistic wait times between requests
  - Extracts data from responses for subsequent requests (e.g., IDs)
  - Includes error handling and logging

  Follow Locust best practices:
  - Use @task decorator with weights
  - Use self.client for making requests
  - Store shared data in self attributes
  - Use context managers for setup/teardown if needed
  - Add descriptive names for better reporting

  Generate Locust TaskSet classes based on the API analysis.

  Use the analysis data to understand endpoint groups and relationships.

  For each endpoint group (e.g., Users, Products, Orders):
  1. Create a separate TaskSet class
  2. Implement tasks for each endpoint in that group
  3. Set realistic task weights (common operations get higher weights)
  4. Handle data dependencies between requests

  Example structure for each TaskSet:
  ```python
  from locust import TaskSet, task, between
  import json
  import random

  class UsersTaskSet(TaskSet):
      wait_time = between(1, 3)

      def on_start(self):
          # Setup code, e.g., login
          pass

      @task(3)  # Higher weight for common operations
      def list_users(self):
          with self.client.get("/users", catch_response=True) as response:
              if response.status_code == 200:
                  response.success()
              else:
                  response.failure(f"Got status code {response.status_code}")

      @task(2)
      def get_user_details(self):
          # Use data from previous requests
          pass

      @task(1)
      def create_user(self):
          # POST with realistic payload
          pass
  ```

  Save each TaskSet to a separate file in {{ output_dir }}/tasks/
  Files should be named: users_tasks.py, products_tasks.py, etc.

  Configuration:
  - Test complexity: {{ test_complexity }}
  - Include authentication: {{ include_auth }}

  If test_complexity is "advanced", include:
  - Data-driven tests with parameterized inputs
  - Complex user flows with multiple dependent requests
  - Performance-focused optimizations
