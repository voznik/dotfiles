prompt: "Analyze the pr with the name {{ pr }}. Find out what has changed, try to\
  \ figure out why these\nchanges were made and tell the user in detail what you found\
  \ out.\n{% if repo %}\nWe are working with the {{ repo }} repository, so make sure\
  \ to add that to all commands.\n{% endif %}\n\nSteps:\n1. Find the actual pull request.\
  \ {{ pr }} is the name or part of it. You can just run\n   `gh pr list`\n   and\
  \ see which prs are open. Note which one the user is talking about\n2. Look at what\
  \ is changed. You can run:\n   `gh pr view <pr-number> --comments --commits --files`\n\
  \   to get an overview.\n3. Optionally: if this looks complicated you could check\
  \ out the relevant commit and have\n   a look at the files involved to get more\
  \ context. If you do this, mark which branch you\n   were on. If there are pending\
  \ changes, do a git stash\n4. Gather your thoughts and tell the user what changed,\
  \ which changes look like they might\n   be worth an extra look and give them an\
  \ idea of maybe why these changes were needed\n5. Clean up after yourself. If you\
  \ cloned a repository or checked out a commit, make sure\n   you return the state\
  \ to what it was before. So if in step 3 you changed branch, change\n   it back.\
  \ If you had git stashed something, stash pop it again.\n"
