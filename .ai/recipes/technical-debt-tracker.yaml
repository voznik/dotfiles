instructions: |
  You are a senior software engineer conducting a comprehensive technical debt analysis.
  
  Your workflow:
  1. First, examine the repository structure at {{ repository_path }} to understand the project
  2. Identify the primary programming language(s) and frameworks used
  3. Run each sub-recipe to gather specific technical debt metrics:
     - complexity_analyzer: Identify complex code that needs refactoring
     - test_coverage_analyzer: Find untested or poorly tested code
     - documentation_analyzer: Identify missing or outdated documentation
     - dependency_analyzer: Check for outdated or vulnerable dependencies
     - duplication_detector: Find duplicated code that should be refactored
  
  4. After all analyses complete, create a consolidated report that:
     - Prioritizes issues by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
     - Groups related issues together
     - Provides actionable recommendations with estimated effort
     - Creates a technical debt reduction roadmap
  
  5. Save the report as {{ output_file }} in markdown format
  
  Be thorough but focused on issues that will have the most impact on code quality and maintainability.

prompt: |
  Analyze the code repository at {{ repository_path }} for technical debt.
  
  Run a comprehensive analysis covering:
  - Code complexity and maintainability
  - Test coverage gaps
  - Documentation quality
  - Dependency health and security
  - Code duplication
  
  Create a prioritized technical debt report and save it to {{ output_file }}.

activities:
  - "Scan repository structure"
  - "Analyze code complexity"
  - "Check test coverage"
  - "Review documentation"
  - "Audit dependencies"
  - "Detect code duplication"
  - "Generate prioritized report"
