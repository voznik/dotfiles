  Here's what to do step by step:
    1. The current folder is a software project. Scan it and learn as
       much as possible.
    2. Based on what you find, write a read me file that contains a
       general description of the project, how to get started and how
       to run the tests. Only mention future plans if you find explicit
       todo's. Do not write about future plans or licenses or anything
       that you can't find explicit support for.
    3. Write this out as README.tmp.md.
    4. Look at the existing README.md. If it exists and the version you
       wrote out is not really better, just tell the user that what
       exists is really good enough and you can exit.
    5. If your version is better or no README.md exists, make your version
       the current one
    6. If you are on main or master, create a new branch
    7. If the only chance at this point is the modification to the the
       README.md, create a new commit 
    8. Clean up after yourself, delete the README.tmp.md after use.
