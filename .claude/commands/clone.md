Clone the current conversation so the user can branch off and try a different approach.

Steps:
1. Get the current session ID and project path: `tail -1 ~/.claude/history.jsonl | jq -r '[.sessionId, .project] | @tsv'`
2. Find clone-conversation.sh with bash: `find ~/.claude -name "clone-conversation.sh" 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1`
   - This finds the script whether installed via plugin or manual symlink
   - Uses version sort to prefer the latest version if multiple exist
3. Run: `<script-path> <session-id> <project-path>`
   - Always pass the project path from the history entry, not the current working directory
4. Tell the user they can access the cloned conversation with `claude -r` and look for the one marked `[CLONED <timestamp>]` (e.g., `[CLONED Jan 7 14:30]`)
